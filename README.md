My name is Dominik Koterwa and I am a Data Science student at University of Warsaw. :blush:

In the future I plan to connect my interests in Music and AI to analyze sound via Data Science.

:seedling: I'm currently learning NLP, Deep Learning and Maths behind AI Music.

I highly encourage you to see some of my little project, here on GitHub or by clicking the links:

:zap: Fun fact: I love watching animals by using a trail camera.
